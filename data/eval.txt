In my view , a carrier should tell his or her relatives about the result as firstly , there is a possibility that they might get the disease or they might be a carrier too and hence they have a right to know .	In my view , a carrier should tell his or her relatives about the result as firstly , there is a possibility that they might get the disease or they might be a carrier too and hence they have a right to know .
